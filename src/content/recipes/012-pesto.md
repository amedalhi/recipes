notes:
  [
    "Traditionally its made with just basil, but Babish mentioned that it can be made with any other green herb for variance. When I first made this I didn't have enough basil so I blended in spinach and even a few sprigs of parsley to make up the difference. It came out great and I'm tempted to say that a quarter of the herbs should be spinach",
