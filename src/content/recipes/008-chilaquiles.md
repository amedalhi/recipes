notes:
  [
    "I know, I know! Epazote shouldn't be optional according to the purists, but honestly I've never used it so I can't comment (yet) on the dogma. So for now, for me, it's optional.",
    "I prefer batching out the servings so I can prevent the tortilla chips from getting soggy. Plus you can control how saucy you want them.",
    "I've seen recipes that use tomatillos instead of tomatoes, I'm going to try that next.",

1. Cut corn tortillas into triangles, fry them in batches until golden brown. Set aside for now.
2. In a medium sauce pan, bring the guajillos, chiles de arbol, and tomatoes to a boil. When tomatoes are fork tender kill the heat and transfer the ingredients into a blender once everything has cooled down.
3. Puree the chiles and tomatoes with the onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, knorr, water, and salt.
4. Strain the salsa to remove solids.
5. In a frying pan, heat up some oil. Add salsa to the hot oil. Bring down the heat to a low simmer and continue to cook through. (this is the step where you would add the epazote)
6. Taste salsa and season with salt to taste.
7. In a mixing bowl\* portion out fried tortillas, ladle in some salsa and toss until evenly coated.
8. Transfer to a plate and top with queso fresco, crumbled chorizo (my fav), thinly sliced raw onions, and cilantro.
9. Serve with a fried egg and bob's your uncle...or t√≠o.
