notes:
  [
    "It has to have tomatoes, but aside from that you can add whatever else you think would go well. I typically add: carrots, baby corn, squash, etc. Brad Leone (inspiration) also adds leeks, bell pepper, and potatoes",
    "Turn it Thai by adding ginger, lemongrass, a bit of curry paste, and finish off with some cilantro and lime ",
    "Serve with rice, or not",

1. Mise en place: dice veg into large uniform pieces, keep cherry tomatoes whole, roughly mince garlic, salt & pep the chicken.
2. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
3. In a large cast iron pan, sear the chicken thighs skin side down until golden crispy.
4. Flip chicken and continue cooking for 5 minutes.
5. Add garlic, saute for 30 seconds before adding the rest of the veggies.
6. Add coconut cream, and about a 1-2 cups of water (you want the sauce to be brothy, and ideally not to fully cover the thighs)
7. Transfer to the preheated oven and braise for 30 minutes or until chicken thighs are fully cooked.
8. Season the sauce.
