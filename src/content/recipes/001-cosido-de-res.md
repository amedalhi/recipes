notes:
  [
    "Don't bother making this if you don't use shank, as a thank you for your efforts you can have a bone marrow taco",
    "Beef chuck is fine/optional, sometimes I'll use beef neck with plenty of meat still on the bones. Other times I simply use more shank",
    "The vegetables I noted above are my favorites, but others will use Mexican Squash instead of zucchini, chayote is something I grew up eating but never my favorite so its optional",
    "Some will add cabbage, I've yet to try it, but will update the recipe when I do",
