    "Don't bother making this if you don't use shank, as a thank you for your efforts you can have a bone marrow taco.",
    "Beef chuck is filler meat, sometimes I'll use beef neck with plenty of meat still on the bones. Other times I simply use more shank.",
    "Removing the scum in the early minutes helps avoid a cloudy broth.",
    "The vegetables I noted above are my favorites, but others will use Mexican Squash instead of zucchini, chayote is something I grew up eating but was never my favorite so its optional.",
    "Some will add cabbage, I've yet to try it, but will update the recipe when I do.",

1. Soak and rinse the shanks, bones, beef for ~10 minutes to remove some of the impurities for a clearer broth.
2. In a large stock pot, place all of the beef and enough water to cover it plus an ~inch.
3. Bring to a boil, skim off the scum\*, and lower heat to a rolling simmer.
4. Add 1 onion cut in half, few sprigs of cilantro, and ~3 TBSP of salt. Cook for 1.5 - 2 hours until almost fork tender.
5. In the meantime prep the vegetables by chopping them into evenly large pieces.
6. When beef is almost done, add vegetables in stages based on cooking times to avoid mushy veggies. Start with corn, carrots, and green beans.
7. Start seasoning with salt to taste at this point.
8. 10 minutes later, add potatoes.
9. 15 minutes later, add zucchini.
10. Continue simmering until all vegetables are cooked and the beef is fork tender.
11. Finely chop cilantro and onion for serving and garnishing.
12. Serve with corn tortillas, favorite salsa (I always make a tomatillo salsa to go with this), lime, and chopped onion/cilantro.
