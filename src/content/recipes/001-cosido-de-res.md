    "Don't bother making this if you don't use shank, as a thank you for your efforts you can have a bone marrow taco.",
    "Beef chuck is fine/optional, sometimes I'll use beef neck with plenty of meat still on the bones. Other times I simply use more shank.",
    "The vegetables I noted above are my favorites, but others will use Mexican Squash instead of zucchini, chayote is something I grew up eating but never my favorite so its optional.",
    "Some will add cabbage, I've yet to try it, but will update the recipe when I do.",

1. In a large stock put, place all of the beef and enough to water to cover it plus and inch.
2. Bring to a boil, skim off the scum, lower heat to rolling simmer
3. Add 1 onion cut in half, couple sprigs of cilantro, and ~3 TBSP of salt. Cook for 1.5 - 2 hours until almost fork tender.
4. In the mean time prep the vegetables by chopping them into even large pieces.
5. When beef is almost done, add vegetable in stages based on cooking times to avoid mushy veggies. Start with corn, carrots, and green beans.
6. 10 minutes later, add potatoes.
7. 15 minutes later, add zucchini.
8. Continue simmering until all vegetables are cooked and the beef is fork tender.
9. Finely chop cilantro and onion for serving and garnishing.
10. Serve with corn tortillas, favorite salsa (I always make a tomatillo salsa to go with this), lime, and chopped onion/cilantro
