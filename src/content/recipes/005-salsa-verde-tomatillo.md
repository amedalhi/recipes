notes:
  [
    "This version is the easiest to whip up, but you can easily roast all of the ingredients and now you have a roasted tomatillo salsa.",
    "If spice averse, don't blend all of the peppers at once. Serranos vary wildly in spiciness so it's hard to have a consistent flavor. Blend with half of the peppers, season and taste. You can always add more, but you can't subtract.",

1. De-husk and wash the tomatillos, remove the stems from the peppers.
2. In a saucepan, bring the tomatillos, serranos, chile de arbol, and onion to a boil, simmer for 5-10 mins or until tomatillos are easily pierced with a fork.
3. Transfer the veg into a blender and blend with the cilantro and a bit of salt. You can thin out the salsa with a bit of the cooking liquid.
4. Season to taste.
