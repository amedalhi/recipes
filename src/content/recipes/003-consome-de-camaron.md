1. In a medium stock pot, sauté tomatoes, onion, garlic, and chiles.
2. Remove dried chiles as soon as they've picked up some color to avoid developing bitterness.
3. Add in the shrimp shells and continue sauteing everything together for a few minutes.
4. Add water along with half a bunch of cilantro, celery, dried shrimp, Knorr tomate, oregano, and garlic powder. Simmer for 20 mins.
5. Transfer all but shrimp shells, celery, cilantro, and broth to a blender. Blend until pureed.
6. From your broth, remove all of the shrimp shells, celery and cilantro with a slotted spoon.
7. Reintroduce the puree into the broth, simmer, and season to taste.
